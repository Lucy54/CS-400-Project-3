# CS-400-Project-3
Campus Navigator using Dijkstra's Shortest Path

Project Name: [UW-Madison Campus Navigation]

Proposal Link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1go_QbMeQsDNfXC148dA2yNhFX4OjZD51U1fbnPoEd90/edit]

## Short Description:
[In this application, the users will be prompted to enter the location (ex. The building name in string). Then, they will also be asked to type the destination (the name of the building in strings). By doing so, the application will function similarly to Google Map’s ability to give you a path based on the starting and ending locations that you entered. However, for our application, since we are incorporating the Dijkstra’s algorithm, our returning value will be a string containing the shortest path from starting location to the destination. For instance, starting location: “Memorial Union”, destination: “CS Building”, the returned string will return “Memorial Union, …, Psychology Building, …, CS Building”. We can also provide how many miles the users have to traveled from point A to point B. So, the goal is to generate the shortest path based on miles traveled (in doubles) from one location to another. 

This application can be the most useful for the freshman students or anyone who are not yet familiar with the campus. It can help them to know which path that should take to get from one of the buildings in UW-Madison campus to the other buildings.
